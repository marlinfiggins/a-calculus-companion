Applying the triangle inequality, we see that $\\abs{f'(x)}\\leq \\abs{\\cos(x)\\cdot e^{\\sin(x)}} +\\abs{\\sin(x)\\cdot e^{\\cos(x)}}$. Using the fact $\\abs{\\sin x}, \\abs{\\cos x}\\leq 1$ and $e^x$ is montonically increasing, we say that $\\abs{f'(x)}\\leq 2e-2$. Therefore by the theorem above, we see that\n",

    "We can repeat this analysis on a function for which we know the value of the integral already. Consider $f(x)=\\sqrt{2-x^2}$. Simple geometry shows this is a half circle with radius $\\sqrt{2}$ and that area of this circle is given by $$\\int_{-\\sqrt{2}}^{\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{2-x^2}dx=\\pi.$$ Therefore, we can see that $\\abs{f(x)}\\leq 1$ and that our error $E_n$ is bounded by $\\frac{16}{n}$. Therefore, we can estimate $\\pi$ within a certain value using this integral.Once again applying the first theorem, and in doing so, we see that we need $n=16000$ to approximate $pi$ within $0.001$. We check this with the code below."

    "Since the bound we used was crude, relying on the *worst case* estimate, $n=16000$ may not be the minimum $n$ needed, but that any $n>16000$ is guarrenteed to work. Testing, we can see that $n=800$ is suffiecent for the accuracy we wanted. Even though computationally, we can't actually get the limit the above theorem helps us to see what the limit might exist. Ideally, we don't want to have to use these methods everytime we want to solve an integral problem, so the next section will develop 'short-cuts' we can use in calculating the derivative."
