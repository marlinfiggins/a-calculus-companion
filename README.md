# A Calculus Companion

This is a repository for hosting my manuscript in progress "A Calculus Companion".

It is intended to be a crash course to calculus based on intuition and would hopefully be a supplement to a first-time calculus course as well as a good refresher for someone who has seen calculus before.

At its core, I believe the purpose of this book is to develop calculus from ideas taught in math class to tools that underlie the mathematics in the world around us. With this goal in mind, I'll be developing computational companions in the form of scripts and Jupyter notebooks which show how these ideas are implemented in problem solving. Similarly, I will be developing long-form homework problems with are themed with multiple steps which highlight applications of calculus in different disciplines.

## To do:
- [ ] Switch code base to Julia completely
- [ ] Add examples to the manuscript
  - [ ] Create "exploratory" problem sets with themes for different applications
- [ ] Add Julia notebooks implementing 'practical applications' of these ideas
  - [ ] Limits
  - [ ] Linear approximation
  - [ ] Derivatives
  - [ ] Riemann sums
  - [ ] Integration
- [ ] Brainstorm possible themes for homework sets using tools
